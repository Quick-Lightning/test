                The L.N.Birla Debate initially started its journey as a local debate in 1994 wherein it was restricted to the schools of Kolkata. The tremendous response it evoked enthused the management to diversify the reach and the debate took on a Pan India dimension. The Inter Institutional L. N. Birla National Debate as its nomenclature suggests traversed the length and breadth of India. In the north, students from schools and colleges of Jaipur, Lucknow and Delhi pitted their arguments against each other while their counter parts in the south did so in Coimbatore, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai. The western zone was represented by the speakers of Pune, Nagpur and Mumbai whereas the battle of wits in the eastern zone was fought in Ranchi, Bhubaneshwar, Jamshedpur and of course the home ground Kolkata.  The L.N.Birla Inter Institutional Debate conducted zone wise across the country culminated with the finals in Kolkata. This was in keeping with our founder’s dream to create a nation of independent thinkers who would lead the country to a brilliant future yet sensitive to the needs of the underprivileged and the downtrodden.
